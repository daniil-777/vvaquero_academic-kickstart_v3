  I volunteer and help on teaching an intensive bootcamp about machine learning 
  from simple regression and classification problems to complex deep learning networks.   
  My objective was to consolidate my Machine Learning skills by teaching and solving questions while helping on the development of the course.
  By teaching complex concepts that fastly learned during my PhD, I was able to gather a better understanding as well as get to know 
  new frameworks and ways to work.
