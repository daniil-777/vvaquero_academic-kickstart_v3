# Biography


Hi!
I am about to defend my Ph.D in Robotics and Computer Vision from [IRI](www.iri.upc.edu), BarcelonaTech and looking for further chellenging industry oportunities. At the moment I am doing an internship in the Machine Learning team inside Toyota Research Institute ([TRI](www.tri.global)) and during my PhD I also completed another stay in [Valeo](www.valeo.com), inside the Driving Assistance Research unit (Germany), 

My research have focused on the use of Deep Learning techniques to understand Autonomous Driving situations based on 3D pointcloud information from LiDAR sensors. However, I am opening to any other challenging topics such as Human Machine Interaction, or robotics perception. 

I complement my background with a great passion about technology and entrepreneurship, which expand my interests to other fields such as Marketing, Blockchain or Investments. 
This, in combination with my soft skills and creativity makes me feel very comfortable creating 
new methods and innovative solutions as well leading working groups and projects.
