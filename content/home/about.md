# Biography


Hi!
I am a close-to-finish Ph.D student in Robotics and Computer Vision at IRI, BarcelonaTech.
My research focuses on scene understanding for Autonomous Driving situations, mainly using Deep Learning methods with LiDAR data.
I have participated in several national and european projects. 
Recently, I have completed a research internship in Valeo Driving Assistance Research (Germany), 
obtaining a wider insight about real Autonomous Vehicles, sensors and methodologies. 


I complement my background with a great passion about technology and entrepreneurship. 
This, in combination with my social skills and creativity makes me feel very comfortable creating 
new methods and innovative solutions as well leading working groups and projects.
